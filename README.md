# 🚰 WATER POTABILITY PREDICTION

> The supply of safe drinking water is one of the greatest public health achievements ever! Potable water should be accessible to all. Using machine learning algorithms, this project aims at providing an easy way of predicting if water is potable or not.

> The dataset used in this project was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability)

##  ℹ️ Overview 
>  The goal of this project is to predict which water body ispotable for use considering the properties of the water body.
>  Water quality refers to the chemical, physical and biological characteristics of water based on the standards of its usage. 
As lack of access to fresh water has becoming increasing, with rapid population growth and climate change taking place Esp in Africa countries. Which will have a severe impact on different sector of the socio-economic ranging from health, education, agriculture, productivity, sustainable development. Hence, this project seek to drive a position change by using water quality historical data to predict whether the quality of water is suitable for human consumption or not or for other activities such as agriculture etc.
